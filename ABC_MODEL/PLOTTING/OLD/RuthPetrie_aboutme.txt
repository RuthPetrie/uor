Ruth completed an MSc. in Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate at the University of Reading
in 2008. Her MSc. project (with Dr. Sarah Dance) was on Localization in the Ensemble 
Transform Kalman Filter.

Since then Ruth has been working for a PhD at the University of Reading with Dr. Ross 
Bannister.  She has been investigating background error covariance modelling for 
convective scale data assimilation. As part of this project a new non-hydrostatic 
toy model of intermediate complexity was derived and implemented to be used to
investigate the convective scale data assimilation problem.  Ruth has been 
investigating the applicability of the linear normal modes as the 
uncorrelated control variables for the control variable transform in variational assimilation.
Ruth has also been investigating hybrid covariance modelling techniques.
