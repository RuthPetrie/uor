$Name: netcdf_toolbox-1_0_11 $

After unpacking the netcdf toolbox, you should adjust your matlab path
as follows.  

addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf 
addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf/nctype
addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf/ncutility

or if on Windows, 

addpath C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf 
addpath C:\gpath\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf\nctype
addpath C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf\ncutility

It could reside on another drive as well.

And remember to remove any previous version of the netcdf toolbox from
your path as well.

Windows Users Take Note:
========================================================================
The "netcdf.dll" file from the mexnc distribution needs to be on your 
in order for mexnc to work, but this causes a namespace clash with the
"netcdf.m" file in the netcdf toolbox.  You need to make sure that
"netcdf.m" PRECEDES "netcdf.dll", or else the netcdf toolbox will not
work.  In other words, from the matlab command line, type

    >> which ( 'netcdf', '-all' );

You should see something to the effect of 

    C:\path\to\netcdf_toolbox\netcdf\@netcdf\netcdf.m
    C:\path\to\MATLAB\bin\netcdf.dll                    % Shadowed 
    C:\path\to\MATLAB\bin\win32\netcdf.dll.

So "netcdf.m" MUST come first.


AUTOSCALING
========================================================================
If you wish to automatically scale your data and have fill values replaced
by NaNs, you should define a global structure called "nctbx_options"
as follows:

    >> global nctbx_options;
    >> nctbx_options.theAutoscale = 1;
    >> nctbx_options.theAutoNaN = 1;

You can place this code in your startup.m if you don't want to continually
have to do this upon starting matlab.
